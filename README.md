# Lean AI

Lean AI is a side-by-side industrial AI benchmark PoC built around one simple hypothesis:

> **Agents should spend tokens on reasoning, not on deterministic data reduction.**

The same synthetic industrial case is evaluated through four architectures:

1. **Agent-only baseline** — agents query a broad raw source universe and the K&KH corpus directly.
2. **Lean / NiFi-assisted** — deterministic preprocessing filters, correlates, normalizes and contextualizes the same evidence before agents reason.
3. **Lean + Jev** — the Lean state is evaluated as typed probabilistic decisions; a frontier reasoner is called only when confidence/ambiguity crosses the escalation policy.
4. **Lean + open zero-shot** — the same typed-decision contract is implemented with an open zero-shot classifier as a control experiment.

## Benchmark scenarios

### Aerospace · Non-conformance investigation

Synthetic dimensional NCR on a structural component. Evidence includes machine telemetry, inspection results, work orders, engineering definition, supplier information, historical NCRs and a small K&KH corpus.

Specialist agents: Quality, Manufacturing, Design and Supervisor.

Human gate: final quality/engineering disposition remains mandatory.

### High-Tech · AI Factory infrastructure anomaly

Synthetic GPU-rack incident during a high-load distributed AI workload. Evidence includes GPU/rack telemetry, liquid cooling/CDU, network fabric, DCIM, workload impact, infrastructure configuration, historical incidents and K&KH content.

Specialist agents: Thermal, Infrastructure, Network, Knowledge and Supervisor.

Human gate: Infrastructure Operations approval remains mandatory before intervention.

Parallel baseline:
raw enterprise data -> agent/tool retrieval -> specialist agents -> supervisor -> human gate
```

**Corpus = what the organization knows.**  
**Deterministic layer = what is relevant now.**  
**Decision models = what can be classified/scored quickly.**  
**Frontier models = what still requires deeper reasoning.**  
**Humans/workflow = what is authorized to happen.**

## Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8088
```

Open `http://localhost:8088`.

Without API keys the application explicitly runs in **simulation mode**.

## Jev

Set:

```bash
TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
TYPESAFE_MODEL=jev-latest
JEV_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.80
JEV_ESCALATION_PROBABILITY=0.50
```

The app sends one shared Lean state with parallel `choice`, `score` and `noul` questions. If confidence is too low or ambiguity is too high, it escalates once to the existing frontier reasoner.

Simulation values must not be presented as measured TypeSafe performance. Review the applicable TypeSafe agreement before publishing live provider benchmark/performance results.

## Open zero-shot control

The default deployment keeps this lane lightweight and simulated. To run a real local Hugging Face control:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-zero-shot.txt
export ZERO_SHOT_MODE=local
export ZERO_SHOT_MODEL=facebook/bart-large-mnli
```

This deliberately implements the same decision surface as Jev so the benchmark tests the architectural hypothesis rather than simply comparing Jev with a much larger generative model.

## Calibration lab

The Calibration tab uses a small labeled industrial smoke-test corpus and reports:

- classification accuracy
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
- multiclass Brier score
- negative log loss (NLL)
- confidence-vs-accuracy reliability buckets

The built-in corpus is only a smoke test. For deployment decisions, replace it with **300+ representative labeled examples from the target process**.

When a provider is simulated, the UI marks the calibration results **SIMULATED ADAPTER — NOT MODEL BENCHMARK EVIDENCE**.

## Docker / Apache NiFi

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

App: `http://localhost:8088`  
NiFi: `https://localhost:8443/nifi`

The current application uses a Python implementation of the deterministic NiFi contract so the experiment is runnable immediately. A future step is to replace that adapter with real NiFi Process Groups while preserving the same input/output contract and instrumentation.
